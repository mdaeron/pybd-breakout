# pybd-breakout

This is a board to facilitate experimenting with the [pyboard-D](https://pybd.io). It provides an easy way to connect jumper wires to many of the pyboard's pins without having to solder anything to the pyboard itself.

Here is a picture of the PCB I ordered from Osh Park. Production and shipping to France took 20 days.

The reference for the WBUS connectors is [Hirose DF40C-40DS-0.4V(51)](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=h11625ct-nd) (thanks to [alustig3](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=6164) for figuring it out).
